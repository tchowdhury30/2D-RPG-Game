### Description
Embark on an exciting adventure with **Hansel** and **Gretel** in this engaging 2D RPG game! Navigate through a mysterious forest, avoid hidden monsters, and make strategic decisions to conquer challenges and thrive. Inspired by classic children's fairytales, this game blends adventure, strategy, and real-time gameplay into an immersive experience.

### Technologies & Skills Gained
This project was my first step into full-scale game development, and it helped me develop a solid foundation in multiple essential areas:

- **Java Programming**: As my first experience with Java, I deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. I designed and implemented various game mechanics, such as player movement, combat systems, and event handling, all of which required efficient and clean code.

- **Game Development with Processing**: Learning to use Processing for 2D graphics and animations allowed me to create visually engaging environments and characters. This hands-on experience helped me understand the importance of frame rates, drawing functions, and rendering smooth animations, all critical components in game development.

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: I applied core data structures such as **arrays** and **lists** to efficiently store and manage dynamic game data, such as player stats, monster attributes, and environmental elements. Implementing **collision detection algorithms** and managing interactions between these objects challenged me to optimize code performance and precision.

- **Sound Integration**: Integrating the **Processing Sound Library** for background music and sound effects enhanced the player experience, creating a more immersive and dynamic environment. This was my first experience synchronizing sound with game events, and I quickly learned how critical timing is for enhancing gameplay.

- **Real-Time Interaction & Game Loop**: Designing and implementing a responsive **game loop** taught me how to manage real-time player input, such as movement, combat actions, and event triggers. Understanding the game loop’s impact on performance and synchronization was key to maintaining a smooth user experience.

### Key Challenges & Lessons Learned

- **Transition to Game Development**: My biggest challenge was transitioning from traditional programming languages like **Python** and **Java** to building interactive graphics-based applications. Learning how to use **Java** with **Processing** to create real-time graphics was a steep learning curve, but it dramatically improved my problem-solving skills and ability to adapt to new technologies.

- **Collision Detection**: One of the most difficult problems was implementing collision detection to ensure the game mechanics felt natural and fair. I developed algorithms to check interactions between game objects, including the player and monsters, and refined these algorithms to improve gameplay fluidity.

- **Optimizing Performance**: As the game evolved, handling multiple objects and their interactions in real-time became increasingly complex. I focused on optimizing the game’s performance by carefully managing game states and reducing unnecessary calculations to ensure smooth gameplay, even with multiple entities on the screen at once.

- **Sound Synchronization**: Integrating **sound effects** and ensuring they were synchronized with in-game events posed another challenge. By managing the timing of sounds based on gameplay triggers (e.g., monster encounters, item pickups), I was able to enhance the overall game experience, which provided valuable insights into game design principles.

### How To Launch
1. **Using Processing IDE**:
   - Make sure you have **Processing 3.5** or later installed.
   - **Install the Sound Library** in Processing (if you haven't already):
     - Go to **Sketch** → **Import Library** → **Add Library**, and then search for **Sound** and install it.
   - Open **`Woo.pde`** in **Processing** by navigating to the file and opening it directly.
   - Click **Run** in the Processing IDE.
   - Ensure your device has at least a **1600x960 display** for proper rendering.

> **Note**: The game might take a few seconds to load, so please be patient.
