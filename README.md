# 2D-RPG-Game

### Description
We have attempted to program a 2D rpg game losely based on children's fairytales. Join Hansel and Gretel as they try to navigate their way through a forest. Make sure to watch out for any monsters hiding in the grass! And have fun! It took a lot of time :/

### How To Launch
In order to launch it please type processing Woo.pde into the terminal of a computer that has atleast a 1600 x 960 display and press Run.
Make sure to also have the official sound library installed or comment out the lines Woo.pde that concern sound.
Please be patient when running it as it may take a few seconds to load.
